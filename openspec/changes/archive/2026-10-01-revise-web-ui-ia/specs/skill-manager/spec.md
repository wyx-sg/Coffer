## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Expose unmanaged-skill operations on REST, CLI and web
Unmanaged-skill operations MUST be available through the REST API, through the top-level `coffer scan`, `coffer adopt skill <path>` and `coffer discard skill <path>` commands (with `--json` on `scan`), and through the agent's Skills tab in the web UI. The command line groups them with every other thing an agent holds that Coffer does not manage, so neither `coffer skill` nor `coffer agent` carries an unmanaged-skill command. Delivery itself is not an operation on this surface: it is controlled by the skill resource's `enabled` flag and `scope` through `coffer skill enable|disable|scope` and the matching resource routes. The agent detail page decides nothing about delivery: its Skills tab lists the skills Coffer delivers to that agent, each opening its page on the Skills page, beside the unmanaged skills found on that agent's disk (see [agent-registry](../agent-registry/spec.md) "Filter an agent's installed kinds by owner"). The agent's Skills tab is the only web surface that lists unmanaged skills or adopts them; the Skills page lists managed skills only (see "Cover skill management on REST, the CLI and the web").

#### Scenario: manage unmanaged skills with scan, adopt and discard
- **GIVEN** a registered agent with two hand-placed skill folders in its skills directory
- **WHEN** the user runs `coffer scan --agent <agent> --json`, then `coffer adopt skill <one path>`, then `coffer discard skill <other path>` and confirms it
- **THEN** the scan is JSON naming both folders as rows of kind `skill`, the first becomes a managed skill and leaves the next scan, and the second is removed from disk
- **AND** neither `coffer skill` nor `coffer agent` offers an `unmanaged`, `adopt` or `rm-unmanaged` command

#### Scenario: unmanaged skills are adopted only from the agent's Skills tab
- **GIVEN** an agent with a hand-placed skill folder
- **WHEN** the user looks for it in the web UI
- **THEN** the agent's Skills tab lists it with Adopt, and the Skills page does not list it
