## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Flag tools whose client-visible name is too long
The system MUST compute, for every discovered tool, the length of the name a client shows for
it, `mcp__coffer__<server>__<tool>`, and MUST flag each tool whose client-visible name is longer
than 64 characters, which is the limit model provider APIs place on a tool name. The flag MUST
appear on the server's Tools tab and in `coffer mcp cap list`, each carrying the length and a
note that some clients drop tool names longer than 60 characters. `coffer mcp cap list --json`
MUST carry the length on every tool row. Flagging MUST NOT disable, rename or hide the tool.

#### Scenario: a tool with an over-long client-visible name is flagged
- **GIVEN** a registered server whose upstream exposes one tool whose `mcp__coffer__<server>__<tool>` name is 70 characters long and one whose name is 40 characters long
- **WHEN** the user opens the server's Tools tab and runs `coffer mcp cap list <server> --json`
- **THEN** the long tool is flagged on both surfaces with its length and a note that some clients drop names above 60 characters, and the short one is not flagged
- **AND** both tools stay enabled and are still listed to clients under their usual names

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Forward tools, resources and prompts
The system MUST forward MCP `tools`, `resources`, and `prompts` capabilities (list, call/read/get, and
list-changed notifications) between clients and upstream MCP servers.

- **Tools-only upstreams.** An upstream that implements only `tools` and replies with JSON-RPC `-32601`
  (METHOD_NOT_FOUND) for `resources/list` or `prompts/list` MUST be treated as having no resources / no
  prompts: the per-server capability view and the aggregate lists return that server's tools with an empty
  resources/prompts set (HTTP 200), not an error.
- **Built-in tools.** Coffer's own built-in tools under the reserved `coffer__` prefix MUST be exactly
  `coffer__search_tools` and `coffer__write`. `coffer__search_tools` MUST always be advertised in
  `tools/list`. `coffer__write` MUST be advertised only while the `knowledge` experimental feature is
  switched on ([experimental-features](../experimental-features/spec.md) "Withdraw what a switched-off feature put in front of agents"),
  and its contract is [knowledge](../knowledge/spec.md)'s. A call to any other `coffer__` name MUST be
  answered as an unknown tool.
- **Built-in tool retrieval.** `coffer__search_tools`
  ([Tool Overload](../../../docs/decisions/tool-overload-tier-the-list-search-the-rest.md)) has the contract
  `coffer__search_tools(query: string [required], top_k?: int = 5, max 20) -> { tools: [{ name, description,
  inputSchema, score }], total_searched: N }`. It ranks the **live** aggregated upstream catalogue against the
  query and returns the top-k **real** upstream tool schemas, which the agent then calls directly; it is a
  retrieval primitive and MUST NOT select-and-invoke on the agent's behalf. Ranking MUST be a pure,
  deterministic, local keyword ranker (BM25-lite over each tool's name + description, with name tokens
  weighted higher) — no LLM, no embeddings, no network. Results MUST be upstream-only (Coffer's own
  `coffer__` built-ins excluded); each returned `name` is the same `<server>__<tool>` identifier the agent
  would call directly, with routing unchanged; and the invocation MUST be recorded in the invocation log like
  any other gateway call.
- **Budgeted listing ("tool tiering").** `tools/list` MUST advertise a budgeted slice of the catalogue rather
  than all of it ([Tool Overload](../../../docs/decisions/tool-overload-tier-the-list-search-the-rest.md)).
  Coffer's own `coffer__*` tools are always listed and do not consume the budget. Upstream tools are listed in
  full while they fit the budget (default 50, `COFFER_TOOL_TIERING_BUDGET`); beyond it the gateway lists the
  most-invoked ones over a trailing window (default 90 days, `COFFER_TOOL_TIERING_WINDOW_DAYS`), reserving one
  slot per server so no server becomes wholly invisible. Unlisted is **not** disabled: `tools/call` MUST gate
  on the capability preference, never on list membership, so an unlisted tool routes exactly as before, and
  `coffer__search_tools` keeps ranking the **full** catalogue. Tiering MUST fail open —
  `COFFER_TOOL_TIERING=off`, or any failure of the usage query, lists everything. The split is not reported on
  a management page.
- **`initialize` instructions.** The `initialize` response MUST carry an MCP `instructions` string stating
  what Coffer is and that `coffer__search_tools` reaches whatever tiering left unlisted. It is capped (~800
  characters) and omits the tiering sentence when nothing is actually hidden.
- **Degraded upstream discovery.** When a server misses the per-server discovery budget its tools are left
  out of that listing, but the server MUST be **named**, retried in the background, and on recovery the
  gateway MUST emit `notifications/tools/list_changed` so the client re-lists.

#### Scenario: resources forward through the gateway
- **GIVEN** an upstream server exposes resources (not only tools),
- **WHEN** a client reads a resource by its coffer URI,
- **THEN** coffer routes the read to the originating upstream with the URI rewritten back to its upstream form and returns the upstream payload unchanged.

#### Scenario: prompts forward through the gateway
- **GIVEN** an upstream server exposes prompts (not only tools),
- **WHEN** a client invokes a prompt by its `<server>__<prompt>` namespaced name,
- **THEN** coffer routes the request to the originating upstream with the original (unprefixed) prompt name and returns the upstream payload unchanged.

#### Scenario: upstream tool list changes mid-session
- **GIVEN** a client is connected and an upstream MCP server's tool list changes (upgrade, plugin reload),
- **WHEN** the upstream emits a list-changed notification,
- **THEN** coffer forwards the notification to every client whose session subscribes to that upstream so the client re-lists, and coffer's cached capabilities are refreshed on next list.

#### Scenario: search the aggregated catalogue for matching tools
- **GIVEN** N upstream tools are aggregated and healthy through coffer,
- **WHEN** an agent calls `coffer__search_tools` with an intent query and a `top_k`,
- **THEN** it receives at most `top_k` ranked real upstream tool schemas (upstream-only, with Coffer's own `coffer__` built-ins excluded), each named `<server>__<tool>`, the response reports `total_searched`, and the gateway records the invocation.

#### Scenario: the gateway advertises exactly two built-in tools
- **GIVEN** the `knowledge` experimental feature is switched on, and then switched off
- **WHEN** a client lists tools through coffer each time, and calls `coffer__recall` and `coffer__diagnose`
- **THEN** the `coffer__` tools listed the first time are exactly `coffer__search_tools` and `coffer__write`, and the second time exactly `coffer__search_tools`
- **AND** both calls are answered as unknown tools

### Requirement: Manage MCP servers as resources
Users MUST be able to register, list, view, update, enable, disable and delete MCP servers as
resources addressed by the immutable `uid` the framework mints for them
([Resource Identity Is an Immutable `uid`](../../../docs/decisions/resource-identity-is-an-immutable-uid.md));
the per-server routes are `/api/v1/resources/mcp_server/{uid}/…`.
Validating that registration against the kind's schema, rejecting a duplicate name within the kind, and
persisting nothing on a validation failure are [resource-framework](../resource-framework/spec.md) "Validate every registration and persist nothing on failure", which every kind inherits; this
requirement is what brings `mcp_server` under it, and the kind-agnostic surface those operations are served
through is that spec's too.

A server's `name` is the prefix of every capability name an agent sees, so `mcp_server` declares its name
fixed: once registered it MUST NOT change, and a changed name MUST be refused with `NAME_IMMUTABLE`
([resource-framework](../resource-framework/spec.md) "Treat a resource's name as a mutable label"). A server
MAY carry a title, which surfaces show in place of the name
([resource-framework](../resource-framework/spec.md) "Carry an optional editable title on every resource").
At registration the name MUST be at most 24 characters, in addition to the existing name pattern and the ban
on `__`; a server registered earlier with a longer name MUST keep it and keep working.

- Registering a server whose upstream is unreachable MUST still succeed (the config is saved); discovery and
  health report the failure, the server is marked unhealthy until reachable, and there MUST be no silent
  retry storm.
- Registering a server whose credential is missing MUST fail with a message naming the missing credential and
  pointing the user at the credential setup path, persisting no partial state.
- Registering a server with a name that already exists within the kind MUST be rejected with a clear error;
  a partial write is impossible.
- The `coffer mcp` group MUST offer the lifecycle verbs `list`, `show`, `add`, `edit`, `rm`, `enable`,
  `disable` and `scope`, plus `test` and `cap` (see "Toggle individual capabilities"). `coffer mcp test
  <server>` MUST re-query the server's capabilities and then report its health, so one command both
  refreshes what Coffer knows of the server and says whether it answers.
- The `coffer mcp` CLI MUST exit with code 3 and name the condition on stderr when no daemon is reachable
  and one cannot be started (a missing daemon is started on demand, and only a failed or timed-out start
  exits 3), and its `list` subcommand MUST support machine-readable `--json` output.
  The same exit covers a daemon that stops answering after the command has connected to it: the lost
  connection is reported once, as a message naming the condition, never as a traceback.

#### Scenario: register a stdio MCP server
- **GIVEN** the coffer daemon is running and no MCP servers are registered,
- **WHEN** the user registers a stdio MCP server with a unique name, command, and arguments,
- **THEN** the server is persisted, its capabilities are discovered, and listing servers shows it as healthy.

#### Scenario: CLI returns non-zero exit on daemon unreachable
- **GIVEN** the daemon is not running and cannot be started (the spawn fails or the daemon does not come up within the boot timeout),
- **WHEN** `coffer mcp list` is invoked,
- **THEN** the process exits with code 3 and stderr names the daemon-unreachable condition.

#### Scenario: CLI --json output is machine-readable
- **GIVEN** `coffer mcp list` and `coffer log mcp` each support `--json`,
- **WHEN** each is invoked with `--json`,
- **THEN** stdout is a parseable JSON document with stable top-level keys (`resources` for `coffer mcp list`, `invocations` for `coffer log mcp`) and no human-readable framing.

#### Scenario: a daemon lost mid-command exits 3
- **GIVEN** a `coffer mcp list` whose client was built against a daemon that has since stopped answering,
- **WHEN** the command makes its request,
- **THEN** the process exits with code 3, and stderr names the daemon-unreachable condition exactly once and carries no traceback.

#### Scenario: a server name longer than 24 characters is refused at registration
- **GIVEN** the coffer daemon is running, and a server registered before the cap with a 30-character name
- **WHEN** the user registers a new server whose name is 25 characters long, and then one whose name is 24 characters long
- **THEN** the first is refused as a validation error naming the 24-character limit, with nothing persisted, and the second is registered
- **AND** the earlier server keeps its 30-character name, and its tools are still listed and callable

#### Scenario: test re-queries capabilities before reporting health
- **GIVEN** a registered server whose upstream has gained a tool since Coffer last discovered it
- **WHEN** the user runs `coffer mcp test <server>`
- **THEN** the command reports the server's health, and `coffer mcp cap list <server>` then lists the new tool
- **AND** for a server whose upstream is unreachable, the command exits non-zero and names the failure

### Requirement: Toggle individual capabilities
Users MUST be able to enable or disable individual tools, resources, and prompts on a per-server basis.
Disabling a tool MUST make it disappear from any client's next tool-list response and MUST make any call
attempt on it fail with a tool-disabled error (JSON-RPC code -32000, TOOL_DISABLED).

On the command line the capabilities MUST be read with `coffer mcp cap list <server> [--type
tool|prompt|resource] [--json]` and toggled with `coffer mcp cap enable|disable <server> <ref>...`, where
each ref names its type: `tool:<name>`, `prompt:<name>` or `resource:<uri>`. A ref that names no capability
the server offers MUST be refused with nothing changed.

#### Scenario: disable an individual capability
- **GIVEN** a registered MCP server exposes several tools,
- **WHEN** the user disables one tool,
- **THEN** subsequent tool-list requests from any client omit it, and an attempt to call it returns a tool-disabled error.

#### Scenario: disabled capability rejected through the shim
- **GIVEN** a registered MCP server with two tools, where one has been disabled via the REST API,
- **WHEN** a shim client calls `tools/list` and then `tools/call` on the disabled tool,
- **THEN** `tools/list` omits the disabled tool while listing the enabled tool, and `tools/call` returns a JSON-RPC error with code -32000 (TOOL_DISABLED) rather than a successful result.

#### Scenario: the command line toggles capabilities by typed ref
- **GIVEN** a registered MCP server exposing a tool and a prompt
- **WHEN** the user runs `coffer mcp cap disable <server> tool:<tool> prompt:<prompt>`, then `coffer mcp cap list <server> --type tool`
- **THEN** both capabilities are disabled, and the list shows only tools, with the disabled one marked disabled
- **AND** `coffer mcp cap enable <server> tool:no-such-tool` exits non-zero and changes nothing

### Requirement: Record invocations without content
The system MUST record an invocation entry for every tool call, resource read, and prompt fetch — its target,
timestamp, duration and outcome — without recording arguments or return contents. How long those entries are
kept, and the background pass that prunes them, are [resource-framework](../resource-framework/spec.md) "Prune each registered log table on its own retention period" — the retention contract
every log-writing kind inherits — not this spec's own rule. This spec contributes `mcp_invocations` to that
registry with a 30-day default. The record is read per server
(`GET /api/v1/resources/mcp_server/{uid}/invocations`, `coffer log mcp --server <server>`) or across every
server (`GET /api/v1/mcp/invocations`, `coffer log mcp` with no server), the cross-server read
including Coffer's own built-in calls (`coffer`) and deleted servers' rows (`deleted:<name>`); both CLI forms
take `--status`, `--since`, `--limit` and `--json`.

#### Scenario: invocation log records calls without arguments
- **GIVEN** an MCP client has invoked tools,
- **WHEN** the user views the invocation log,
- **THEN** every call is present with timestamp, target capability, duration, and outcome, and **no call arguments or return contents are stored**.

#### Scenario: the command line reads the invocation log
- **GIVEN** a running daemon that has recorded invocations on two servers, on a Coffer built-in tool and on a deleted server
- **WHEN** the user runs `coffer log mcp --server <server>` and then `coffer log mcp --status error --json`
- **THEN** the first prints only that server's calls, newest first
- **AND** the second prints, under `invocations`, only failed calls across every server, each naming its server, including `coffer` and `deleted:<name>` rows

### Requirement: Take the agent identity from the handshake
The system MUST accept a self-reported agent identity at MCP handshake as the agent's **uid**
(`params._meta["coffer/agent-uid"]`, alongside the existing `coffer/cwd` key), written into a managed agent's
shim invocation as `coffer-mcp-shim --agent-uid <uid>` by the Coffer-MCP install ([agent-registry](../agent-registry/spec.md) "Install Coffer's MCP server into an agent in one action") —
the uid rather than the name, because the entry is written once into a file Coffer does not revisit and a name
goes stale on the first rename. A session's reported identity is carried for the life of that connection and
used for every subsequent list and call.

- A `_meta` carrying only the older name-based key MUST be treated as reporting no identity rather than
  resolved by name.
- A session with no reported identity (a hand-configured shim invocation, or any client that omits
  `--agent-uid`) MUST be treated as `agent=None`, matching only servers that carry no scope — never a scoped
  one, even one naming the agent that happens to be running unidentified. An unidentified session sees
  strictly less, never more.
- Identity is self-reported, not cryptographically verified — a documented trust boundary, acceptable under
  the loopback-only, single-user posture [daemon](../daemon/spec.md) holds: any local process able to open the
  loopback MCP connection and set `_meta` could claim any agent uid.
- Identity is reported **once, at the handshake**, and nowhere else: when the gateway threads the identity
  into a Coffer built-in tool call (as the `agent` argument the knowledge write tool attributes material by), it
  MUST overwrite any `agent` the client put in the call's arguments with the session's, and MUST drop the
  argument entirely when the session reported none — so a client cannot pick a different identity per call,
  and no built-in tool advertises `agent` in its input schema.

#### Scenario: a name-only handshake is treated as unidentified
- **GIVEN** one server scoped to a single agent's uid and one unscoped server,
- **WHEN** a session's handshake `_meta` carries only the older name-based `coffer/agent` key naming that agent,
- **THEN** the session reports no identity,
- **AND** its `tools/list` shows only the unscoped server's tools.

#### Scenario: a built-in tool call carries the session's identity, not the client's
- **GIVEN** a session whose handshake reported a registered agent's uid, and a second session that reported none,
- **WHEN** each calls a Coffer built-in tool with an `agent` argument naming a different agent,
- **THEN** the identified session's call reaches the tool with its own agent in `agent`, and the unidentified session's call reaches it with no `agent` argument at all,
- **AND** no built-in tool Coffer advertises in `tools/list` declares `agent` in its input schema.
