## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Merge the manual and the catalogue in the skill body
The skill's **body** MUST be one merged manual: Coffer's own — its one built-in tool, `coffer__search_tools`, and when to reach for it; the tiering contract that makes an unlisted upstream tool still callable; the knowledge root and the memory root, and that Coffer's distilled memory notes are Markdown under the latter which the agent finds by searching that directory with its own tools; that Coffer's own logs are read with `coffer log` and located with `coffer path logs`; that `coffer cli list` lists the command-line tools Coffer manages, what each is for and whether it is ready on this machine; the fact that Coffer reads an agent's memory and never writes it; that no Coffer tool waits on a human approval; and what does not belong in knowledge — **followed by** the catalogue: the path of the knowledge root, and, for each collection, every document's collection-relative path, title and description. It MUST instruct the agent to read those files with its own tools, to write a Markdown file into a collection's `.inbox/` when it learns something durable (see "Submit material by writing a file into the inbox"), and that it may also correct or extend a document it has read by editing the file itself, which the next sweep carries into the rest of the collection (see "Keep direct file edits a complete way to change knowledge"). One skill, not a set: a frontmatter description is resident in every session whether the skill is opened or not, while a body is paid for only when a model reaches for it, so a second skill would spend the resident budget again to describe something most sessions never open.

#### Scenario: the skill body carries the catalogue and the absolute root
- **GIVEN** a collection holding three documents
- **WHEN** the skill is rendered
- **THEN** its body carries each document's collection-relative path, title and description, and the path of the knowledge root, and it instructs the agent to read those files with its own tools
- **AND** the frontmatter `description` names the collection's subject, taken from the collection's own `README.md`, so a model matching on it has something to match

#### Scenario: name one tool, both roots and the log reader in the manual
- **GIVEN** a vault with one collection
- **WHEN** the skill is rendered
- **THEN** its manual names exactly one built-in tool, `coffer__search_tools`, and names none of `coffer__write`, `coffer__recall` and `coffer__diagnose`
- **AND** it names the knowledge root and the memory root with the instruction to search them with the agent's own tools, tells the agent to add knowledge by writing a file into a collection's `.inbox/`, and names `coffer log` and `coffer path logs` as the way to read Coffer's own logs, and `coffer cli list` as the way to learn which command-line tools Coffer manages
