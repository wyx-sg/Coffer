## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Deliver a skill only where it is enabled and in scope
A skill MUST be delivered to an agent if and only if the skill resource is enabled AND the skill's scope admits that agent — `skill.enabled AND is_active(skill.scope, agent=<agent>)`, one allow-list, left `null` admitting anything ([ADR per-agent-resource-scope](../../../docs/decisions/per-agent-resource-scope.md)). This is the same shape `mcp_server` uses, where scope alone decides which agents see a server's tools. The scope states:

- `None` — every registered agent receives the skill (the default for a fresh import).
- `{"agents": ["<agent uid>"]}` — only those agents receive it. The scope holds agent uids ([ADR resource-identity-is-an-immutable-uid](../../../docs/decisions/resource-identity-is-an-immutable-uid.md)); the CLI and web UI let the user pick agents by name and store their uids. A uid that matches no agent registered here is legal and simply never matches.
- `{"agents": []}` — nobody receives it, while the skill stays in the library, converged and visible.

Those two together are the skill's REACH, and reach is machine-local: it is set on the machine it applies to, a converge round neither carries it away nor writes over it (spec vault-sync, "Keep reach machine-local"), and the predicate therefore takes no machine argument and has no machine to take. What converges is the skill — its files, its metadata — unless it is Coffer's own generated one (see "Regenerate Coffer's builtin skill from the build"). A skill can still be delivered here and dormant on another machine — that is two machines each holding their own `enabled` flag and their own scope, not one scope naming machines. The surface that sets reach MUST say that the setting stops at this machine.

No other flag decides which agents a skill is FOR: neither the delivery bookkeeping of "Track delivered copies as internal bookkeeping" nor any field on the agent resource; the agent resource carries no skill-delivery policy at all. `enabled` is a real switch: disabling a skill reclaims every delivered copy (master untouched) and re-enabling redelivers it to every agent its scope still grants. Scope is a hard grant: narrowing it to exclude an agent reclaims that delivery on the next reconcile even if the copy got there some other way, and widening it delivers; no per-agent state can hold a copy against the scope or keep one away from an agent the scope grants. A DISABLED AGENT is a separate matter and is never written into by delivery — the predicate names the agents a skill belongs to, while an agent the user switched off ([agent-registry](../agent-registry/spec.md) "Switch an agent off with the kind-agnostic enabled flag") is one Coffer does not deliver into; its held copies are reclaimed and re-enabling it reconciles them back. The one exception is adoption ("Adopt an unmanaged skill"): the folder being adopted is already in that agent's skills directory, so it is replaced in place by the managed link even when the agent is disabled — and, like any copy a disabled agent holds, that link is reclaimed by the agent's next reconcile. A reconcile that finds a delivered copy the predicate no longer grants MUST reclaim it (remove the link, clear the delivery record) per "Reclaim a delivered copy without touching master", and MUST deliver a copy the predicate now grants but the agent does not hold. This predicate governs **delivery** — writing a skill into an agent's own filesystem — and is the only path by which a skill reaches an agent (see "Expose no skill tools over MCP").

#### Scenario: a skill with no scope reaches every registered agent
- **GIVEN** two registered agents and an enabled skill whose scope is unset (`None`),
- **WHEN** the delivery reconcile runs for each agent,
- **THEN** both agents hold a delivered copy, and registering a third agent delivers the skill there too with no further user action.

#### Scenario: a skill scoped to no agent reaches nobody
- **GIVEN** two registered agents each holding a delivered copy of an enabled skill,
- **WHEN** the user sets the skill's scope to `[]`,
- **THEN** both delivered copies are reclaimed, the skill remains in the library (still listed, still exported), and no agent receives it until its scope grants one again.

#### Scenario: disabling a skill reclaims every delivered copy
- **GIVEN** an enabled skill delivered to two agents,
- **WHEN** the user disables the skill resource,
- **THEN** both symlinks are removed and both delivery records are cleared, while the skill's scope and its master folder are unchanged.

#### Scenario: re-enabling a skill redelivers it
- **GIVEN** a disabled skill with no delivered copies and a scope granting two agents,
- **WHEN** the user re-enables the skill resource,
- **THEN** it is redelivered to both agents — links re-created, delivery records restored — with no per-agent action.

#### Scenario: scoping a skill away from an agent reclaims the delivered copy
- **GIVEN** an enabled skill currently delivered to an agent whose uid its scope includes,
- **WHEN** the user edits the skill's scope to exclude this agent and the next reconcile runs,
- **THEN** the delivered symlink is removed and the delivery record is cleared — scope is a hard grant, and no per-agent state can hold the copy against it.


### Requirement: Adopt an unmanaged skill
Users MUST be able to adopt a valid unmanaged skill. Adoption validates the folder per "Validate imported skill folders against AgentSkills", moves it to `~/.coffer/skills/<name>/`, registers the `skill` resource, delivers the managed link (see "Deliver a skill as a directory link"), and records an enabled binding for that agent — in that order, with any failure before registration leaving the original folder unmoved and unchanged (after registration the master copy is authoritative; a delivery failure is surfaced and retried via the binding, never rolled back). The managed link is always delivered to the agent's canonical delivery location `<config_dir>/skills/<name>`: adopting from `<config_dir>/skills` replaces the original path in place, while adopting from `~/.agents/skills` consolidates — the original folder there is removed and the link lands in `<config_dir>/skills` (Codex reads both locations, so the agent keeps seeing the skill). Name collisions MUST be rejected with `conflict` (409); invalid folders and symlinks pointing outside the master store MUST be rejected with `unprocessable_entity` (422). Adoption is audited as an adoption event. Adopting from a disabled agent is allowed and links in place exactly as for an enabled one, recording the binding — the folder was already there, so the agent sees no new content; the exception this makes to "Deliver a skill only where it is enabled and in scope" ends at the agent's next reconcile, which reclaims the link as it does every copy a disabled agent holds, and re-enabling the agent delivers it back.

#### Scenario: adopt an unmanaged skill into the master store
- **GIVEN** an unmanaged skill folder with a valid SKILL.md whose name collides with no master skill,
- **WHEN** the user adopts it,
- **THEN** Coffer validates it per "Validate imported skill folders against AgentSkills", moves the folder to `~/.coffer/skills/<name>/`, registers the `skill` resource, replaces the original path with the managed link, records a binding for that agent, and audits the adoption — and on any failure the original folder is left exactly where and as it was.

#### Scenario: reject adopting an invalid or conflicting unmanaged skill
- **GIVEN** an unmanaged entry that lacks a valid SKILL.md, collides with an existing master skill's name, or is a symlink pointing outside the master store,
- **WHEN** the user attempts to adopt it,
- **THEN** the request is rejected with a reason-specific error (invalid: `unprocessable_entity` 422; name conflict: `conflict` 409; foreign link: `unprocessable_entity` 422), and nothing is moved, registered, or linked.

#### Scenario: adopting from a disabled agent links the skill in place
- **GIVEN** a disabled agent whose skills directory holds a valid unmanaged skill folder,
- **WHEN** the user adopts that folder,
- **THEN** the folder's content is in the master store, the original path is now the managed link to it, an enabled binding for that agent is recorded, and the adoption is audited under the skill's name.


### Requirement: Offer every skill operation on REST, CLI and web
Every management operation MUST be available through (a) the REST API, (b) the `coffer skill ...` CLI with `--json`, and (c) the Skills page in the web UI — except `verify`, which has no web surface ("Report skill drift on request"), and the master-folder file viewer and editor ("Show a skill's master folder read-only", "Save an existing skill file conditionally"), which are REST and web only and have no CLI command. Per-(skill, agent) enable/disable is not among them: the `POST /skills/{name}/enable` and `POST /skills/{name}/disable` routes and the `coffer skill enable|disable` CLI commands are REMOVED. Delivery is driven by the skill's `enabled` flag and `scope` through the generic resource surfaces — `coffer scope set skill <name> --agents …` and `coffer resource enable|disable skill <name>`.

The Skills page is a data table (search, filter, pagination, row multi-select for bulk actions) with import via a folder picker. It manages the skill resource itself, not per-agent bindings: a skill's detail view has an Overview metadata tab and a Files tab (file tree plus the viewer of "Show a skill's master folder read-only"), where every file and folder offers "open in external editor" and "reveal in file manager". The list's reach column and the detail page carry one reach button labelled with the answer ("Every agent", "2 agents", "Disabled") that opens a panel whose choices are Disabled, Every agent and Only selected agents — the last over the scope's list of agents, staged there and written once when the panel closes — and the list's reach filter offers those same states.

#### Scenario: desktop and CLI cover every operation
- **GIVEN** the daemon is running,
- **WHEN** the user performs each operation via the web UI and via `coffer skill ...`,
- **THEN** the same effect is achieved in either surface and CLI provides `--json` for read operations.


### Requirement: Save an existing skill file conditionally
The system MUST provide a write that overwrites an **existing text file** in the master folder, under the same containment guard and size cap as "Show a skill's master folder read-only"; it MUST refuse to create new files/directories here, to write outside the folder, or to overwrite a binary file with text. The write MUST be atomic with no symlink-following out of the folder. The in-app editor and programmatic REST clients share this one endpoint; there is no CLI command for it. Because the master folder is also a folder the user edits in their own editor, file reads MUST return a **content fingerprint** (a digest of the file's raw on-disk bytes — not of the possibly-truncated text returned, so an oversized file's fingerprint still round-trips and an edit past the truncation point is still detected), and a write MAY carry that fingerprint back: when it no longer matches the bytes on disk the write MUST be rejected with `conflict` (409) and the file left byte-identical, so the user re-reads and reapplies rather than silently losing the other edit. A write that omits the fingerprint stays unconditional (last writer wins), which is what a programmatic client that never read the file first needs.

#### Scenario: edit and save a skill file
- **GIVEN** an imported skill that contains an existing text file,
- **WHEN** the user edits that file in the in-app editor (or a programmatic REST client saves new contents for it) by its folder-relative path, passing back the fingerprint the read returned,
- **THEN** Coffer overwrites the file atomically and returns the file's new fingerprint, and a subsequent read returns the new contents; writing a non-existent path, a path outside the master folder, an existing binary file, or content over the size cap is rejected (`404`/`400`) and the file is left unchanged. A save that omits the fingerprint still writes, so programmatic clients that never read the file first keep working.

#### Scenario: reject a stale save of a skill file
- **GIVEN** an imported skill file opened in the in-app editor, whose read returned a content fingerprint,
- **WHEN** the user changes that same file in their own external editor and only then saves the in-app buffer with the now-stale fingerprint,
- **THEN** Coffer rejects the save with `conflict` (409, `SKILL_FILE_STALE`) and leaves the externally edited file byte-identical on disk; re-reading yields the current fingerprint and the retried save succeeds.
