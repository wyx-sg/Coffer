## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: List every stored and cited secret with what uses it
`coffer secret list` and `GET /api/v1/secrets` MUST list every ref the
store holds and every ref a registered resource cites, each with whether the
store holds it, whether this Mac's key can open it (`locked`), when it was
stored (`created_at`) and when a consumer last had it decrypted on this Mac
(`last_used_at`, stamped at most once a minute and not by a reveal), the resources that cite it, for a standalone secret its
`coffer://secret/<name>` and the skills whose files cite that URI, whether
nothing references it (`unreferenced`), the destinations it is approved for or
waits on, and whether another process of this user can read the value where
Coffer puts it (a standalone secret, or a stdio MCP server's environment). The
listing decrypts nothing and records no audit entry. It MUST leave out an
agent's model-proxy token (`proxy-token/<agent name>`): Coffer mints it and the
agent fetches it itself, so no person enters, replaces or cites it. A delete MUST also be
refused with `SECRET_IN_USE` while a skill in the master store cites a
standalone secret's URI, naming that skill, and a delete that removes a ref
MUST forget its approved destinations.

#### Scenario: the command line lists every cited ref with its presence
- **GIVEN** a registered MCP server citing a stored ref and a registered model provider citing a ref the store does not hold
- **WHEN** the user runs `coffer secret list`
- **THEN** both refs are listed
- **AND** the MCP server's ref is shown as present and the provider's ref as missing

#### Scenario: a secret nothing references is listed as unreferenced
- **GIVEN** a standalone secret no resource and no skill cites, and another that a skill cites by URI
- **WHEN** the secrets are listed
- **THEN** the first is marked unreferenced and readable by local processes
- **AND** the second names the skill, and deleting it is refused naming that skill

#### Scenario: the list says when each secret was created and last used
- **GIVEN** a standalone secret stored and never used
- **WHEN** the secrets are listed, then `coffer run` resolves it, then they are listed again
- **THEN** the first listing carries its `created_at` and no `last_used_at`
- **AND** the second carries a `last_used_at` no later than now

#### Scenario: an agent's model-proxy token is not listed
- **GIVEN** a stored agent model-proxy token and a stored standalone secret
- **WHEN** the secrets are listed
- **THEN** only the standalone secret is listed
