## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Ship Claude Code and Codex subprocess providers
System MUST ship subprocess-backed agent providers for Claude Code and Codex.
Each runs in a working directory (its `agent_config.cwd`); when a turn supplies
none, the provider MUST default to the Coffer-managed workspace
`~/.coffer/workspace` (created on first use) rather than reject the turn — so a
client with no configured workspace works out of the box. An
explicitly-supplied cwd MUST be an existing directory or the configuration is
rejected. Availability MUST reflect whether the agent's binary is resolvable on
the daemon's PATH; an unavailable agent is listed but not selectable.

A turn MUST stream the tool's line-delimited JSON output mapped onto the
platform's turn events, and persist the upstream session id so the next turn
continues the same session. Claude Code is driven through the Claude Agent SDK
and Codex through `codex app-server` (JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio, NDJSON-framed);
both run with full permissions — owner pairing
([channels](../channels/spec.md)) is the security gate.

Both MUST emit the reply as text increments *as it is written*, not as one
block at the end of the turn, otherwise a live surface has nothing to grow and
a reply lands all at once after a long silence. The Claude Agent SDK does this
only when asked (`include_partial_messages`), and it then delivers BOTH the
increments and the finished assistant message, so the adapter MUST subtract
what it already emitted and send the reply exactly once.

A turn MUST run against the config directory of the agent that answers for its
type — the first enabled agent of that type, the same one whose models the
pickers offer ([agent-registry](../agent-registry/spec.md) "Read the model
catalogue back from the installed agent"). Coffer delivers skills, installs its
MCP entry and edits config files in that directory, so a turn that read any
other one would not see them. When that agent's `config_dir` is not its type's
standard location, the spawned process's environment MUST carry the variable the
product reads it from — `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=<config_dir>` for Claude Code,
`CODEX_HOME=<config_dir>` for Codex — merged with the daemon's own environment
and with any key the provider projects; for the standard location (or when no
agent of the type is registered) the environment MUST be left as the daemon's
own, so the process behaves as when the user runs the CLI themselves.

#### Scenario: a streamed reply reaches the consumer exactly once
- **GIVEN** a Claude Code turn whose SDK delivers the reply as streamed increments and then as the finished assistant message
- **WHEN** the adapter maps the turn onto platform events
- **THEN** the reply arrives as one text delta per increment, in order
- **AND** the joined deltas equal the reply once, not doubled by the finished message
- **AND** the stream ends with a terminal turn-done

#### Scenario: a turn on an agent with its own config directory runs against that directory
- **GIVEN** a `claude_code` agent registered with a `config_dir` other than `~/.claude`, and a `codex` agent registered with a `config_dir` other than `~/.codex`
- **WHEN** a turn runs on each
- **THEN** the Claude Code process is started with `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` set to the agent's `config_dir`, and the Codex app-server with `CODEX_HOME` set to its `config_dir`, the rest of the daemon's environment (and a projected provider key) intact
- **AND** a turn on an agent whose `config_dir` is its type's standard location starts its process with the environment untouched
