## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Register each skill as a resource with a SKILL.md-safe name
The system MUST register each managed skill as a Resource of kind `skill`, identified by the framework's immutable `uid` ([Resource Identity Is an Immutable `uid`](../../../docs/decisions/resource-identity-is-an-immutable-uid.md)). Its `name` is taken from SKILL.md frontmatter at import or adoption, unique within the kind, and MUST satisfy the frontmatter's own charset (`^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{0,63}$`), so Coffer never registers a skill under a name its own importer would reject. The `name` MUST be **fixed** once the skill is registered, because it is the directory an agent loads the skill from and the identifier an agent invokes it by, so it is quoted in places Coffer cannot see ([resource-framework](../resource-framework/spec.md), the requirement that lets a kind declare its name fixed). An update whose `name` differs from the current one MUST be refused with `NAME_IMMUTABLE` (409) before anything moves, on REST and on the web UI alike. The refusal MUST say that a different name means removing the skill and importing it again, and that doing so resets its `enabled` flag, its scope and its deliveries. A skill carries no title ([resource-framework](../resource-framework/spec.md) "Carry an optional editable title on the kinds that have one"): every surface shows its fixed name, beside the SKILL.md `description` agents choose it by, and a title submitted for one is refused as a validation error with nothing changed.

#### Scenario: refuse a skill name its own SKILL.md could not carry
- **GIVEN** the daemon is running and no skill is registered under any of the names below
- **WHEN** the user imports, or adopts, a folder whose SKILL.md frontmatter `name` is `My.Skill`, `MySkill` or `-leading`
- **THEN** each is refused as a validation error before anything is written
- **AND** no `skill` resource exists afterwards and nothing is under `~/.coffer/skills/` for any of them

#### Scenario: refuse changing a registered skill's name
- **GIVEN** an imported skill `before` delivered to a registered agent
- **WHEN** the user submits the name `after` through the resource update route and through the web UI
- **THEN** each is refused with `NAME_IMMUTABLE` (409), and the message says that a new name means removing the skill and importing it again, which resets its enabled flag, scope and deliveries
- **AND** the row, the master folder `before`, its SKILL.md `name: before` and the delivered link are all exactly as they were, and `verify` reports no drift

#### Scenario: a skill's title is edited without touching disk
- **GIVEN** an imported skill `before` delivered to a registered agent
- **WHEN** the user submits the title `Release checklist` for it through the resource update route
- **THEN** the title is refused as a validation error, `coffer skill list` and the Skills page still show `before`, and `coffer skill show before --json` carries no `title`
- **AND** the master folder, its SKILL.md and the delivered link are byte-identical to before the request

### Requirement: Validate imported skill folders against AgentSkills
The system MUST validate every imported skill folder against the AgentSkills specification: `SKILL.md` present; frontmatter `name` present and non-empty (lowercase alphanumerics or hyphen, ≤64 chars) and `description` present, non-empty, and ≤1024 chars; no path-escape symlinks; total size at most 50 MB, a fixed cap. A folder that violates any of these MUST be rejected with `unprocessable_entity` (422) and nothing persisted. A folder over the size limit is rejected as `SKILL_INVALID` with `details.reason` `size_limit_exceeded`.

#### Scenario: reject import of an invalid skill folder
- **GIVEN** the daemon is running,
- **WHEN** the user imports a folder that is missing `SKILL.md` or has empty `name`/`description` frontmatter,
- **THEN** the request is rejected with a clear error, and nothing is written to `~/.coffer/skills/` or the database.

#### Scenario: reject import containing path-escape symlinks
- **GIVEN** the daemon is running,
- **WHEN** the user imports a folder containing a symlink that resolves outside the folder,
- **THEN** the request is rejected with the offending paths listed, and nothing is persisted.

#### Scenario: reject a skill with an over-long description
- **GIVEN** the daemon is running,
- **WHEN** the user imports a folder whose SKILL.md `description` exceeds 1024 characters,
- **THEN** the request is rejected as invalid frontmatter, and nothing is written to `~/.coffer/skills/` or the database.

### Requirement: Cover skill management on REST, the CLI and the web
Every management operation MUST be available through (a) the REST API, (b) the `coffer skill` CLI group with `--json` on every read, and (c) the Skills page in the web UI. The `coffer skill` group MUST offer `list`, `show`, `add <folder|archive|git-url>` (the imports of "Import a skill from a local path", "Add skills from an archive" and "Add skills from a Git repository", with `--ref` and `--path` for a repository, `--skill <name>` (repeatable) or `--all` to pick among several skills, `--yes` to skip the confirmation and `--force` to replace a skill of the same name), `update <name>` ("Update a Git-imported skill from its source", with `--check`, `--yes`, `--take-theirs` and `--keep-mine`), `rm`, `enable`, `disable`, `scope <name> [--agents a,b | --all | --none]` and `verify [--fix]`. `enable` and `disable` switch the skill resource's own `enabled` flag, which with its scope drives delivery ("Deliver a skill only where it is enabled and in scope"); there is no per-(skill, agent) switch on any surface, and the `POST /skills/{name}/enable` and `POST /skills/{name}/disable` routes do not exist. The group offers no `edit`: a skill's name is fixed, it has no title, and its description is its SKILL.md's, edited in the file.

A skill's master folder is plain files a person edits in their own editor. On the command line it is named by `coffer path skill <name>`, which prints the folder's absolute path, and it is read and edited on disk; the `coffer skill` group carries no command that lists, prints or writes a file inside it. The REST file tree, file read and conditional file write ("Show a skill's master folder read-only", "Save an existing skill file conditionally") serve the web UI's Files tab and programmatic clients.

The Skills page is the library of managed skills beside the open skill: a list with search, an All / On / Off filter and row multi-select for bulk reach and bulk delete, next to the selected skill's detail. It has one **Add skill** action whose dialog offers three sources: **Folder** — a path field that takes a folder chosen with the folder picker or a path typed or pasted into it, trimmed of surrounding whitespace and quotes before it is sent; **Archive** — a `.zip` or `.skill` file uploaded from the browser; and **Git repository** — a URL with an optional ref and subpath; under the source, an **Available to** reach control whose choice every added skill takes (every agent unless narrowed). Each source first shows what it found — the skill or skills, their names and descriptions, any that cannot be added and why, and any whose name is taken, with Replace offered for those — and writes nothing until the user confirms. The dialog offers no way to create a new skill from scratch: a skill is authored in the user's own editor and added from where it lives. It shows each skill by its name, which it offers no way to edit. It lists only the skills Coffer manages: an agent's own (unmanaged) skills, and adopting them, live only on that agent's Skills tab (see "Expose unmanaged-skill operations on REST, CLI and web"), and while no skill is managed the page's empty state may link to the agents' Skills tabs but lists nothing from them. It manages the skill resource itself, not per-agent bindings. A row carries a Built-in mark and an Off mark, and in place of its description the one thing that needs the reader, most urgent first: its master folder is gone ("Say when a skill's master folder is gone"), a folder is in the way of an agent's link ("Resolve a folder in the way of a skill's link"), a command it declares is missing, not logged in or too old, its Git source is unreachable, or an update is waiting ("Update a Git-imported skill from its source"). Folders in the skills store that no skill claims are listed apart, under **Not in your library** ("Act on a folder in the skills store that no skill claims"). A skill's detail (`/skills/<name>`, addressed by its fixed name as [web-ui](../web-ui/spec.md) "Lay out every detail page's tabs alike" says) shows its name, reach, a **⋯** menu — Open in editor, Reveal in Finder, Copy master path, Check agents' copies, Turn off, and Delete… (disabled on a builtin skill) — its description, and its master path or, for a Git skill, its repository, folder and pinned commit; above its tabs, a banner for each thing that needs the reader, with at most one action; and it has four tabs, in this order, each at its own path:

- **Files** (the default, `/skills/<name>`) — the file tree beside the viewer of "Show a skill's master folder read-only", opening with `SKILL.md` selected and rendered; a **Preview / Source** toggle switches a Markdown file between rendered and raw text, and **Edit** edits the file in place and saves it through "Save an existing skill file conditionally" (not offered on a builtin skill, which Coffer rewrites at every start). A text file offers **Open in editor**, a binary file **Open in default app** and **Reveal in Finder**, and a file too large to read whole shows its start read-only. A save refused because the file changed on disk keeps the edited text and offers Reload, Compare and Copy my text. There is no separate SKILL.md tab.
- **Delivery** (`/skills/<name>/delivery`) — every registered agent with the state of its copy: linked, copied where links are not allowed ("Fall back to copying where links are unavailable"), differing from master (the drift kinds of "Report skill drift on request" — a folder in the way offers **Review…**), or not delivered and why (the skill is off, the agent is outside its reach, or the agent is switched off); **Check again** runs the drift report afresh.
- **Requires** (`/skills/<name>/requires`) — the commands the skill declares it needs ("Show the commands a skill declares it needs"), each with its state on this machine and opening that command's page on the CLIs page ([web-ui](../web-ui/spec.md) "Show every CLI a skill requires on the CLIs page"); the tab offers nothing that installs or logs in — those live on the CLIs page.
- **History** (`/skills/<name>/history`) — the folder's past versions, from the vault's history once it records a skill's versions; until then the tab says that a skill's versions are not recorded yet.

A skill added from a Git repository also shows its source — the repository, the folder, the pinned commit and the update status — with **Check now** and **Change source…** ("Change a Git-imported skill's source").

The list's reach mark and the detail carry one reach button labelled with the answer ("Every agent", "2 agents", "Disabled") that opens a panel whose choices are Disabled, Every agent and Only selected agents — the last over the scope's list of agents, staged there and written once when the panel closes — and the list's filter offers those same states.

#### Scenario: desktop and CLI cover every operation
- **GIVEN** the daemon is running,
- **WHEN** the user performs each operation via the web UI and via `coffer skill ...`,
- **THEN** the same effect is achieved in either surface and CLI provides `--json` for read operations,
- **AND** `coffer path skill <name>` prints the absolute path of the same master folder the Files tab shows, and `coffer skill` offers no `import`, `files`, `cat`, `write` or `edit` command.

#### Scenario: switch and scope a skill from its own command group
- **GIVEN** two registered agents and an enabled skill with no scope, delivered to both
- **WHEN** the user runs `coffer skill scope <name> --agents <first agent>`, then `coffer skill disable <name>`, then `coffer skill enable <name>`
- **THEN** after the scope change only the first agent holds a delivered link, after `disable` neither does, and after `enable` the first agent holds it again
- **AND** each change is recorded in the audit log

#### Scenario: the skills page lists only managed skills
- **GIVEN** one managed skill and an agent whose skills directory holds two hand-placed skill folders
- **WHEN** the user opens the Skills page
- **THEN** it lists the managed skill only, and offers no Adopt action and no row for either hand-placed folder
- **AND** with no managed skill at all, the empty state links to the agents' Skills tabs and lists no skill

#### Scenario: a skill opens on its files with SKILL.md rendered
- **GIVEN** an imported skill whose folder holds `SKILL.md` and a script
- **WHEN** the user opens its detail page
- **THEN** the tabs read Files, Delivery, Requires and History, Files is selected with `SKILL.md` selected and rendered, and there is no SKILL.md tab
- **AND** switching to Source shows the raw text, and Edit then saving writes the file through the conditional save

#### Scenario: the delivery tab shows each agent's copy
- **GIVEN** a skill scoped to one of two registered agents and delivered to it as a link
- **WHEN** the user opens the skill's Delivery tab
- **THEN** the first agent shows its copy as linked with its path, and the second as not delivered because it is outside the skill's reach

#### Scenario: the history tab says versions are not recorded yet
- **GIVEN** an imported skill
- **WHEN** the user opens its History tab
- **THEN** the tab says that the skill's versions are not recorded yet, and offers no restore

#### Scenario: the add dialog offers three sources and no create
- **GIVEN** the Skills page
- **WHEN** the user chooses Add skill
- **THEN** the dialog offers Folder, Archive and Git repository, and no option to create a new skill

#### Scenario: nothing is added until the user confirms
- **GIVEN** the Add skill dialog showing the skills found in an uploaded archive
- **WHEN** the user closes the dialog without confirming
- **THEN** no skill resource exists for them and nothing is under `~/.coffer/skills/` for them
- **AND** the staging area the archive was read into is removed

#### Scenario: the old overview address opens delivery
- **GIVEN** a skill named `release-notes` and a bookmark to `/skills/<its uid>?tab=overview`
- **WHEN** it is opened
- **THEN** the app lands on `/skills/release-notes/delivery` with the Delivery tab selected
