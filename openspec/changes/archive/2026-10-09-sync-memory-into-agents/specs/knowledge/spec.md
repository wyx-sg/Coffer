## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Merge the manual and the catalogue in the skill body
The skill's **body** MUST be one merged manual: Coffer's own — its one built-in tool, `coffer__search_tools`, and when to reach for it; the tiering contract that makes an unlisted upstream tool still callable; the knowledge root; that Coffer's own logs are read with `coffer log` and located with `coffer path logs`; that a skill's scripts keep their logs, operation journals and temp files under `~/.coffer/skill-data/<skill-name>/` (found with `coffer path skill-data`), never in the skill's own folder or elsewhere in `~/.coffer`, and that files there are deleted after the Skill working files retention window, so durable data does not belong there; that `coffer cli list` lists the command-line tools Coffer manages, what each is for and whether it is ready on this machine; that no Coffer tool waits on a human approval; and what does not belong in knowledge — **followed by** the catalogue: the path of the knowledge root, and, for each collection, every document's collection-relative path, title and description. It MUST instruct the agent to read those files with its own tools, and to write what it learns that is durable straight into the collection's documents, and to tidy a collection when asked (see "Teach writing and tidying in the guide"); a change to a document is carried by the sweep into the vault's history (see "Treat a direct file edit as a complete change"). The manual MUST name no memory directory: an agent reaches memory through its own native memory ([memory](../memory/spec.md) "Deliver no memory into a session"). One skill, not a set: a frontmatter description is resident in every session whether the skill is opened or not, while a body is paid for only when a model reaches for it, so a second skill would spend the resident budget again to describe something most sessions never open.

#### Scenario: the skill body carries the catalogue and the absolute root
- **GIVEN** a collection holding three documents
- **WHEN** the skill is rendered
- **THEN** its body carries each document's collection-relative path, title and description, and the path of the knowledge root, and it instructs the agent to read those files with its own tools
- **AND** the frontmatter `description` names the collection's subject, taken from the collection's own `README.md`, so a model matching on it has something to match

#### Scenario: name one tool, the knowledge root and the log reader in the manual
- **GIVEN** a vault with one collection
- **WHEN** the skill is rendered
- **THEN** its manual names exactly one built-in tool, `coffer__search_tools`, and names none of `coffer__write`, `coffer__recall` and `coffer__diagnose`
- **AND** it names the knowledge root and no memory directory, tells the agent to write durable knowledge into a collection's documents itself, and names `coffer log` and `coffer path logs` as the way to read Coffer's own logs, and `coffer cli list` as the way to learn which command-line tools Coffer manages

#### Scenario: the manual says where a skill's scripts keep their files
- **GIVEN** a vault with one collection
- **WHEN** the skill is rendered, with or without the knowledge and memory features on
- **THEN** its manual says a skill's scripts write their logs, operation journals and temp files under `~/.coffer/skill-data/<skill-name>/`, found with `coffer path skill-data`
- **AND** it says never to write them inside the skill's own folder, that files there are deleted after the Skill working files retention window, and that durable data does not belong there

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Deliver the catalogue through the coffer-guide skill
The catalogue MUST be carried by Coffer's own skill, `coffer-guide`, which MUST be an ordinary registered `skill` Resource — one master folder, `~/.coffer/derived/skills/coffer-guide/`, one resource, delivered by the predicate and the links every imported skill uses ([skill-manager](../skill-manager/spec.md) "Regenerate Coffer's builtin skill from the build", [skill-manager](../skill-manager/spec.md) "Deliver a skill only where it is enabled and in scope", [skill-manager](../skill-manager/spec.md) "Deliver a skill as a directory link"). This layer contributes the **text** and nothing else: it renders, and the skill kind writes, registers and delivers.

This layer MUST NOT push anything into a session of its own accord and MUST NOT write into any agent's own memory files: knowledge is pulled. Writing into an agent's native memory belongs to [memory](../memory/spec.md), and nothing in Coffer puts memory into a session ([memory](../memory/spec.md) "Deliver no memory into a session"). Coffer's own skill is indistinguishable from an imported one everywhere the skill kind touches it — listed, scoped, enabled, delivered, verified for drift and repaired by the same code — and the only thing that sets it apart is that its master folder is Coffer's to rewrite and its deletion is refused.

#### Scenario: Coffer's own skill is an ordinary skill resource
- **GIVEN** a daemon starting with a collection holding documents
- **WHEN** the boot refresh runs
- **THEN** there is one `coffer-guide` master folder under `~/.coffer/derived/skills/` and one `skill:coffer-guide` resource carrying the `builtin` source, and the skills listing shows it beside the user's imported skills
- **AND** this layer has written nothing into any agent's own skill directory itself, and nothing into any agent's memory files

### Requirement: Describe Coffer and the collections' subjects in the skill description
The skill's **frontmatter description** MUST describe Coffer itself — naming its built-in tool so a model recognises it — **and** name the subjects the collections cover, drawn from their READMEs, and, while the knowledge feature is on, that the skill teaches how to write and tidy knowledge (see "Teach writing and tidying in the guide"). It is the only part of this layer that is always in a model's context, so it MUST carry matchable specifics rather than a description of the layer, and it MUST fit the tightest frontmatter ceiling any importer imposes (1024 characters), dropping whole collection subjects from the tail rather than cutting a sentence mid-way.

#### Scenario: one skill carries both Coffer's manual and the catalogue
- **GIVEN** a rendered `coffer-guide` `SKILL.md`
- **WHEN** its frontmatter and its body are read
- **THEN** the description names Coffer and its built-in tool as well as the collections' subjects, and is within 1024 characters — a catalogue too large to fit drops whole collection subjects from the tail rather than ending mid-sentence
- **AND** the body carries the manual first — the built-in tool, the tiering contract and that no Coffer tool waits on an approval — and the catalogue after it, in one file

### Requirement: Keep the handshake instructions to what a skill cannot carry
The MCP gateway's own `initialize` instructions MUST stay within their character cap and MUST carry only what a skill cannot: what Coffer is, the name of its one built-in tool (`coffer__search_tools`) so it is recognisable in a tool list, one line, while the knowledge feature is on, saying that Coffer's knowledge is Markdown read with the agent's own file tools, one line saying that Coffer's own logs are read with `coffer log`, the tiering sentence when tools are actually hidden this session, and a pointer to the `coffer-guide` skill for everything else. It MUST NOT restate the manual, MUST NOT name a memory directory, MUST NOT name a retrieval tool, and MUST NOT carry the catalogue — the catalogue is in the skill body, which costs a session nothing until a model opens it. A built-in tool whose experimental feature is switched off is not in the tool list, and the instructions MUST NOT name it either ([experimental-features](../experimental-features/spec.md) "Withdraw what a switched-off feature put in front of agents").

#### Scenario: name only the search tool in the handshake and point at the skill
- **GIVEN** a real daemon driven over its `/mcp` endpoint by the MCP SDK
- **WHEN** the client initializes, both with upstream tools hidden and with none hidden
- **THEN** the `instructions` text is within its character cap, names `coffer__search_tools`, names none of `coffer__write`, `coffer__recall` and `coffer__diagnose`, and points at the `coffer-guide` skill for the rest
- **AND** it names no retrieval tool and carries no collection catalogue

### Requirement: Delete a document at once, a collection after asking, and offer Undo
The web UI MUST delete a document **at once**: its ⋯ menu's **Delete document** opens no confirmation, because the delete is reversible. **Delete collection** MUST ask first, in a confirmation naming the collection and how many documents it holds, because once its toast closes a collection can no longer be brought back from the page; the confirmation asks for no typed name. The page MUST report either delete in a toast — *Deleted <name>* — carrying **Undo**, which restores what the delete removed (see "Undo a knowledge delete from its toast"), and MUST then show the collection page after a document's delete and the Knowledge page after a collection's. The delete is audited as a `knowledge_deleted` event, and an Undo refused because the path or name is taken again MUST say so rather than overwrite it.

#### Scenario: delete a document at once and undo it
- **GIVEN** a document open in the Knowledge page
- **WHEN** the user chooses ⋯ → Delete document
- **THEN** no dialog asks, the document is gone, the collection page shows, and a toast reads *Deleted <name>* with Undo
- **AND** choosing Undo puts the document back at its path with its text, as one new change by the user

#### Scenario: delete a collection after asking and undo it from the toast
- **GIVEN** a collection with a document
- **WHEN** the user chooses ⋯ → Delete collection and confirms
- **THEN** a confirmation named the collection and its document count before anything was deleted, the collection is gone, the Knowledge page shows, and the toast offers Undo
- **AND** choosing Undo brings the collection back under its name with its document

### Requirement: Show a collection as one tree of read-only documents in the web UI
The web UI MUST present a collection as **one tree** of its documents — no lanes, no tabs, no filter or retrieval box — with the chosen document in the pane beside it, the same two panes a skill's Files tab is. The tree MUST name every collection, folder and document by its name on disk: a collection has no title (see "Name a collection by its folder and edit its description in place"). Its **Collections** header strip MUST carry **New collection** (a name and what belongs in it; the collection reaches every agent through the coffer-guide skill). The tree MUST show no hidden entry, and no collection or folder carries a document count. Knowledge calls its files **documents** everywhere.

A document's pane MUST carry two tabs in its bar, **Document** (the default, `/knowledge/<uid>?file=<path>`) and **History** (`/knowledge/<uid>/history?file=<path>`), neither with a count. Document MUST show the document read-only, with a **Preview / Source** switch, **Open in editor** as a visible button, and a ⋯ menu holding **Reveal in Finder** and **Delete document**. History is the document's versions in the vault and their diffs, with **Restore this version…** ([web-ui](../web-ui/spec.md) "Show a vault file's history on a History tab"). Its properties — who wrote it and when it was created, read from its frontmatter — MUST be one line under its title; there is no side column. The pane MUST NOT edit the document: a person changes it in their own editor and an agent with its own file tools (see "Treat a direct file edit as a complete change"), and the next read shows the change.

A collection's page MUST show its folder name, its description edited in place (see "Name a collection by its folder and edit its description in place") and its properties: **Documents** and **Folder**, and it MUST carry **Tidy** (see "Hand a tidy to the agent"). A collection with no documents shows the same page with one line saying so and how to fill it — upload one, or drop Markdown files into the folder — and **Reveal in Finder**. The collection's ⋯ menu MUST hold **Reveal in Finder**, **Copy path** and **Delete collection** (see "Delete a document at once, a collection after asking, and offer Undo").

The page MUST offer **Upload** into a collection as its one primary action and no other form that adds a document: people write in their own editor, agents by writing files. With no collection open, the page shows its collections and **Tidy all**; there is no Recent changes view. The tree and the pane MUST extend to the bottom of the window and scroll inside.

The Knowledge page's title MUST carry the **Experimental** tag ([experimental-features](../experimental-features/spec.md)).

#### Scenario: the viewer shows one tree of documents
- **GIVEN** a collection page whose tree holds a document at the root and one inside a folder
- **WHEN** the page renders and a document's row is clicked
- **THEN** there is one tree — no lane headings, no tabs, no filter input — listing both documents and no hidden entry
- **AND** the document carries Document and History tabs, offers Open in editor, and Reveal in Finder and Delete document in its ⋯ menu

#### Scenario: the page's one primary action is Upload
- **GIVEN** the Knowledge page with a document open
- **WHEN** the user reads the header and the document's pane
- **THEN** Upload is the primary button
- **AND** no control on the page adds a document from a typed title and body, and the pane offers no Edit

#### Scenario: a document opens in the person's editor
- **GIVEN** a document open in a collection's pane
- **WHEN** the user chooses Open in editor, and then Reveal in Finder from its ⋯ menu
- **THEN** the daemon is asked to open the document's absolute path and then to reveal it
- **AND** the pane shows the document read-only, with Preview and Source, and its created line read from the frontmatter

#### Scenario: a collection page shows its properties
- **GIVEN** a collection holding two documents
- **WHEN** its page renders
- **THEN** it shows the folder name, the description, the Documents and Folder properties and a Tidy button
- **AND** its ⋯ menu offers Reveal in Finder, Copy path and Delete collection

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Merge the manual and the catalogue in the skill body (before memory sync)
**Reason**: A MODIFIED block cannot drop a scenario, and this requirement loses "name one tool, both roots and the log reader in the manual", which described the retired memory layer; it is renamed out of the way, removed, and added again under its own title (see ADDED below).
**Migration**: The dropped scenarios' markers are deleted or pointed at the scenarios of the requirement added again.

## RENAMED Requirements

- FROM: `### Requirement: Merge the manual and the catalogue in the skill body`
- TO: `### Requirement: Merge the manual and the catalogue in the skill body (before memory sync)`
