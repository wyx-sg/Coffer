## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Offer every connection operation over REST and in the web UI
Create, switch, revert-to-built-in, rename, edit, enable and disable, scope and delete MUST be
available via (a) the REST API and (b) the web surfaces — the Model providers library for create and
delete, the Agent detail page for the switch and the revert, the connection's own page for the
rename, the edit, the scope control and the enabled switch (see "Rename a connection without moving
anything else"). The `coffer provider` and `coffer model` commands call the same routes ([resource-framework](../resource-framework/spec.md) "Offer every management operation on the command line"). The list carries no Active column, and a
connection's lifecycle verbs are the ones every kind's page offers. Editing a connection MUST be
available over REST (`PATCH /api/v1/providers/{uid}`: `base_url`, `protocol`, `models`,
`secret_value`, `description`) and from its detail page, including correcting the wire.
Creating one (`POST /api/v1/providers` with a name, a protocol, a base URL and an inline secret, a
secret ref or the `local_runtime` detection) takes no model; a local runtime connection is created
without a key (see "Configure a local model connection"). No route returns a provider's key: the
agents reach a connection through the local model proxy, which injects the key itself (see "Reach
API-key and local connections through the local model proxy"). Reverting is
`POST /api/v1/providers/use-builtin/{agent_type}`, offered by the agent's Change model dialog as its
built-in login: a surface that can put an agent onto a Coffer connection and not take it off again is
half an operation. Which connection speech-to-text runs on is chosen in
Settings › General (see "Keep an independent speech-to-text
default"), not on the connection's own page.

The web surfaces:

- **Model providers** (route `/model-providers`, in the sidebar's Agents group, beside the agents whose models it serves) is
  one page under one header — the title, an Experimental tag, a one-line description and the page's one primary button, **Add provider** — over two tabs, **Providers** and **Usage** ("Show metered usage on a Usage tab of Model providers"). Providers is the connection library: a list of connections beside the open one. It has no view of which agent runs on what and no Coffer's model tab, because an agent's connection is shown and changed in that agent's Overview › Model and the speech-to-text connection is chosen in Settings › General. The page opens on the first connection, and with none it is a welcome panel. Each row shows
  the connection's vendor mark, its name, its protocol and what it offers (its curated model count,
  or all models), and the marks of the agents running on it, read from the agents' `connection_uid`; a filter narrows the list over name,
  title, endpoint and description, and the list is sorted by name, with no order heading and no drag handle on a row. It has no per-row switch, because activation is per agent, and no
  per-row reach or delete: both are on the open connection's header. A row MUST say what Coffer
  ITSELF uses the connection for: the `transcribe_default` connection carries a "Coffer · speech to
  text" badge with a hint naming Settings › General as where it is changed, and the connection's Used by repeats
  it. The label leads with Coffer because a bare "Speech to text" reads as a capability of the
  provider rather than a job Coffer gives it; an agent's mark on a row is a different fact — that
  agent is switched to the connection. The vendor mark is derived from `base_url` by matching the
  preset list (an unmatched endpoint gets Coffer's neutral provider glyph); the name is the user's
  own, and the row links to the detail page by `uid`.
- The add-connection dialog asks for the vendor from a grid of eight equal buttons — Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, Ollama, LM Studio and Custom — which fill in the
  endpoint and protocol (Custom reveals a manual protocol selector), in two steps, Endpoint and then Models. A local runtime (Ollama, LM Studio) asks for no key, offers only the wires the detected runtime serves to agents (Anthropic, OpenAI) and,
  until a runtime is detected, does not let the user go on to Models; the connection's Name
  appears once a runtime is chosen. The dialog surfaces test-connection and list-models with an inline, not-yet-saved
  secret.
- The connection detail (`/model-providers/<uid>`, addressed by `uid` because a connection can be renamed) is one column opened beside the list — Used by, Endpoint, Models — and has no tabs. Its header carries a health pill (Reachable, Key rejected or Unreachable, read from a probe that runs when it opens), the protocol, the host and, when the endpoint answered, how long it took, and the shared
  scope control — the single place the connection's reach and its enabled state are both shown and
  changed — with Test, Edit and a menu holding Delete provider ("Review what deleting a connection changes"). **Used by** is read-only: each agent whose `connection_uid` names the connection (and that the connection still serves),
  with the model it runs, as a link reading "<Agent> › Change model" that opens that agent's page with its Change model dialog already open (`/agents/<type>?change-model=1`); and Speech to text
  when the connection is flagged for it, reading "Settings › General" and opening it. Used by carries no
  switch, activate or revert control, and no row repeats a fault: a connection's fault shows in its header pill and in the section it belongs to (Endpoint for Unreachable or Key rejected, Models for a failed listing).
- Per-agent connection and model selection lives on the agent detail page's **Overview › Model** section and its **Change model** dialog; the agent page has no Model tab. The section reads **Provider**, **Model** and **Route** and carries **Change…**. The dialog is one 480-wide form for both agents ("Review a model change before writing it"), filtered to the connections that reach that agent and narrowed by `enabled`: **Provider** (the agent's built-in login or a connection), then, for a connection, **Model** and, for Claude Code, **Model per tier** (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku, and Fable only when the connection lists a Fable model; see "Suggest a model for each Claude Code tier"). It carries no
  other model setting — no output-limit, subagent, thinking or fast-mode
  control — because what else a model needs Coffer derives and writes itself. Picking a non-built-in
  connection introspects its endpoint and stages a default model — the first model returned — and
  the tier suggestions for it. Picking things in the form is a DRAFT: it writes nothing, and **Review changes** is enabled only once the draft differs from what is applied, names a model and has passed its connection test ("Review a model change before writing it"). On the built-in login Model is the agent's own model and optional, and no test runs. The agent's Overview reads the connection the agent is on from the agent record's `connection_uid`, not from any flag on a connection.

#### Scenario: update a provider profile
- **GIVEN** a connection exists,
- **WHEN** the user patches `base_url` (no `secret_value`),
- **THEN** only that field is updated, `secret_ref` is unchanged, and `resource_updated` is audited.
#### Scenario: the routes cover create, list, switch and revert
- **GIVEN** the daemon is running,
- **WHEN** a client calls `POST /api/v1/providers`, `GET /api/v1/providers`, `POST /api/v1/providers/{uid}/activate` with an `agent_type` and `POST /api/v1/providers/use-builtin/{agent_type}`,
- **THEN** each operation succeeds and the list answers with the connections as JSON,
- **AND** after the revert the agent's `connection_uid` is empty, so the switch that was made can be undone.
#### Scenario: the connections page lists profiles and their compatible agents
- **GIVEN** the connections page is rendered with two mock connections whose reach differs,
- **WHEN** the page renders,
- **THEN** it lists both connections, marks the one an agent runs on with that agent's mark, and shows the open connection's endpoint and its reach in the header's shared control — not as a second column repeating it in words — with NO per-row "Switch" action, because activation is per agent in its Change model dialog (TypeScript acceptance test).

#### Scenario: the library names the connections Coffer itself uses
- **GIVEN** connection A is the speech-to-text default, and connection B carries no flag
- **WHEN** the Model providers library is opened
- **THEN** A's row carries the "Coffer · speech to text" badge and B's row carries none (TypeScript acceptance test)

#### Scenario: the provider library has no tabs
- **GIVEN** the Model providers page
- **WHEN** it renders
- **THEN** its only tab strip is the page header's Providers | Usage, and the library itself has no view of which agent runs on which connection and no Coffer's model tab (TypeScript acceptance test)

#### Scenario: a provider's used-by list is read-only
- **GIVEN** a connection that Claude Code runs on (its `connection_uid`) with a chosen model, and that is flagged `transcribe_default`
- **WHEN** its detail page renders
- **THEN** Used by lists Claude Code with its model, as a link "Claude Code › Change model" to `/agents/claude_code?change-model=1`, and Speech to text, opening `/settings/general`
- **AND** Used by carries no switch, activate or revert control (TypeScript acceptance test)

#### Scenario: the Change model dialog shows only provider, model and tiers
- **GIVEN** a Claude Code agent on a non-Claude connection, and a Codex agent on a connection
- **WHEN** each agent's Change model dialog renders
- **THEN** Claude Code's shows Provider, Model and Model per tier, and Codex's shows Provider and Model
- **AND** neither shows an effort, output-limit, subagent, thinking or fast-mode control
