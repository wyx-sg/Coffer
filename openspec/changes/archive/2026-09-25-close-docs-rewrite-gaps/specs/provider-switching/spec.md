## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Project into Claude Code settings without clobbering them
The system MUST project into the agent's `<config_dir>/settings.json` (`~/.claude/settings.json`
for the default config directory) through
[agent-registry](../agent-registry/spec.md)'s config-write machinery — the atomic write with its
rotated `.bak` ([agent-registry](../agent-registry/spec.md) "Write config files atomically with a backup and an audit entry") and the fingerprint that refuses a write onto content that
changed underneath it ([agent-registry](../agent-registry/spec.md) "Reject stale config-file writes by fingerprint") — merging only the managed keys and preserving
everything else. Coffer MERGES into the user's existing file and never replaces it; a file that does
not exist is created with only the managed keys, and activating a connection MUST NOT touch any key
outside the managed set. The managed key set per agent and the ownership markers that make
de-projection safe are in [data-model.md](data-model.md).

The raw key MUST NOT be written to `settings.json`, `config.toml` or any other native config file;
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` MUST NOT be written. Claude Code instead gets
`apiKeyHelper = "<absolute path to the coffer CLI> provider key --connection-uid <uid>"`, which it
invokes to fetch the key (and re-invokes periodically). The path is absolute because Claude Code
runs the helper with its own `PATH`, which need not contain the directory the CLI is installed in.
De-projection drops `apiKeyHelper` only when it is Coffer's own — a helper line running the coffer
CLI by absolute path, or the bare `coffer provider key` form written by earlier builds — and leaves
a helper the user wrote alone.

Every projection write — this one, the Codex one (see "Project into Codex config without clobbering
it"), and their de-projections — MUST surface a fingerprint refusal as 409 `CONFIG_FILE_STALE` and
MUST audit it as `provider_projection_refused`, so a concurrent edit by the user or by the agent's
own CLI is never silently overwritten.

#### Scenario: activate an anthropic profile writes Claude Code settings
- **GIVEN** a Claude Code agent is registered and a connection reaching it exists,
- **WHEN** the user activates the connection,
- **THEN** `~/.claude/settings.json` contains `apiKeyHelper` naming that connection, `env.ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, and — when the agent's binding names them — `env.ANTHROPIC_MODEL` and `env.ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL`; `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is absent; and the connection's `is_active` becomes `true`.
#### Scenario: switching preserves unrelated native-config keys and writes a .bak backup
- **GIVEN** `~/.claude/settings.json` contains keys Coffer does not manage (e.g. `theme`, `mcpServers`),
- **WHEN** the user activates a connection reaching that agent,
- **THEN** those keys are preserved byte-for-byte in the updated file, a `.bak` file is written before the update (the previous `.bak` rotating to `.bak.1`, then `.bak.2`; three generations are kept), and only the Coffer-managed keys are changed.
#### Scenario: projection refuses to overwrite a concurrent edit
- **GIVEN** `~/.claude/settings.json` that the user saves from their editor after Coffer has read it and before Coffer writes its projection,
- **WHEN** the projection write runs,
- **THEN** the write is refused with 409 `CONFIG_FILE_STALE`, the user's edit is left intact on disk, no `.bak` is written, and an audit row `provider_projection_refused` names the connection, the agent type and the file — the caller re-reads and retries.

### Requirement: Activate a connection into the agents its scope reaches
`POST /api/v1/providers/{uid}/activate` (and `coffer provider switch <name>`) MUST apply the
single-active rule (see "Keep at most one active connection per agent type"), then project into
every ENABLED registered agent the connection's scope reaches. The operation:

1. requires the connection to exist, else 404;
2. projects into each agent its scope reaches, and de-projects the agents the previous connection held
   and this one does not;
3. clears `is_active` on the connections that held those agents, then sets it on the target;
4. emits `provider_switched`;
5. returns `{activated, protocol, projected, skipped}`.

Projection MUST run BEFORE the activation flip, so a failed native-config write aborts the switch
with the registry unchanged. If no agent the connection reaches is registered, it MUST record the
connection active and return a non-empty `skipped` list — NOT an error.

Reach is the framework's per-agent `scope`
([Per-Agent Resource Scope](../../../docs/decisions/per-agent-resource-scope.md)); there is no
`compatible_agents` field in the config, in `ProviderCreate` or in `ProviderPatch`. A new connection
is pre-filled from its wire through the kind's `default_scope` hook — unscoped for a credentialed
wire (including `unknown`, so an inconclusive probe hides nothing and the user decides), which reaches
every agent including one registered later, and nothing (`scope = []`) for `ollama`. Re-targeting is a scope edit (`PUT /api/v1/resources/{uid}/scope`,
`coffer scope set provider <name> --agents …`). `scope = []` is dormant: the connection reaches no
agent, so no agent resolves its key. The projection writer MUST be chosen by AGENT type, not by
protocol: a connection reaching `claude_code` writes Claude's `settings.json` in the anthropic shape
and one reaching `codex` writes Codex's `config.toml`, which is how an OpenAI-compatible gateway is
routed to Claude Code. Coffer translates nothing between protocols.

#### Scenario: activate a profile whose wire matches no registered agent records active but projects nothing
- **GIVEN** no Codex agent is registered and a connection reaching only Codex exists,
- **WHEN** the user activates it,
- **THEN** its `is_active` becomes `true`, no config file is written, and the response carries `skipped: ["codex"]` (or empty `projected`).
#### Scenario: route an openai-compatible connection to Claude Code with its scope
- **GIVEN** a Claude Code agent is registered and an `openai`-wire connection is created and then scoped to `["claude_code"]`,
- **WHEN** the user activates that connection,
- **THEN** it projects into Claude Code's `settings.json` (the anthropic shape) with `apiKeyHelper = "<absolute path to the coffer CLI> provider key --connection-uid <uid>"`, `GET /providers/{uid}/key` returns exactly that connection's key, and the reported agent set follows the scope.
