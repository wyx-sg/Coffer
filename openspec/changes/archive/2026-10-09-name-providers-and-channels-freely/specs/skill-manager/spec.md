## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Register each skill as a resource with a SKILL.md-safe name
The system MUST register each managed skill as a Resource of kind `skill`, identified by the framework's immutable `uid` ([A Resource's Identity Is the `uid` Inside Its File; Path and Name Are Location and Label](../../../docs/decisions/identity-is-the-uid-inside-the-file.md)). Its `name` is taken from SKILL.md frontmatter at import or adoption, unique within the kind, and MUST satisfy the frontmatter's own charset (`^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{0,63}$`), so Coffer never registers a skill under a name its own importer would reject. The `name` MUST be **fixed** once the skill is registered, because it is the directory an agent loads the skill from and the identifier an agent invokes it by, so it is quoted in places Coffer cannot see ([resource-framework](../resource-framework/spec.md), the requirement that lets a kind declare its name fixed). An update whose `name` differs from the current one MUST be refused with `NAME_IMMUTABLE` (409) before anything moves, on REST and on the web UI alike. The refusal MUST say that a different name means removing the skill and importing it again, and that doing so resets its `enabled` flag, its scope and its deliveries. A skill carries no title: every surface shows its fixed name, beside the SKILL.md `description` agents choose it by.

#### Scenario: refuse a skill name its own SKILL.md could not carry
- **GIVEN** the daemon is running and no skill is registered under any of the names below
- **WHEN** the user imports, or adopts, a folder whose SKILL.md frontmatter `name` is `My.Skill`, `MySkill` or `-leading`
- **THEN** each is refused as a validation error before anything is written
- **AND** no `skill` resource exists afterwards and nothing is under `~/.coffer/vault/skills/` for any of them

#### Scenario: refuse changing a registered skill's name
- **GIVEN** an imported skill `before` delivered to a registered agent
- **WHEN** the user submits the name `after` through the resource update route and through the web UI
- **THEN** each is refused with `NAME_IMMUTABLE` (409), and the message says that a new name means removing the skill and importing it again, which resets its enabled flag, scope and deliveries
- **AND** the row, the master folder `before`, its SKILL.md `name: before` and the delivered link are all exactly as they were, and `verify` reports no drift

### Requirement: Keep one master folder per skill
The system MUST store each managed skill's content under `~/.coffer/vault/skills/<name>/`, with that path as the single editable source of truth; it is a vault folder, so every change to it — through Coffer or in the person's own editor — becomes a vault commit naming its writer ([vault-storage](../vault-storage/spec.md) "Admit every vault write through one compare-and-swap path"). Coffer's own builtin skill is the one exception, kept under `~/.coffer/derived/skills/` (see "Regenerate Coffer's builtin skill from the build"). Because the skill's `name` is fixed after registration (see "Register each skill as a resource with a SKILL.md-safe name"), the master folder, every delivered link at `<config_dir>/skills/<name>` and the SKILL.md frontmatter `name` MUST keep that name for the life of the skill. No operation on any surface moves the master folder or rewrites that frontmatter field. Per-agent bindings hold the resource's identity, not its name.

#### Scenario: a refused name change leaves the master folder where it is
- **GIVEN** an imported skill `before` delivered to a registered agent, whose SKILL.md carries comments, other frontmatter fields and a body
- **WHEN** the user tries to change its name to `after`
- **THEN** it is refused, and the master folder and the agent's delivered link are still at `before`, the link resolving to that master, with the same binding row recording the delivery
- **AND** SKILL.md and the skill's `version_hash` are unchanged by the request, and nothing exists at `~/.coffer/vault/skills/after/`
