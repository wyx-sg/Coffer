## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Keep the handshake instructions to what a skill cannot carry
The MCP gateway's own `initialize` instructions MUST stay within their character cap and MUST carry only what a skill cannot: what Coffer is, the names of its four built-in tools (`coffer__write`, `coffer__recall`, `coffer__diagnose`, `coffer__search_tools`) so they are recognisable in a tool list, the tiering sentence when tools are actually hidden this session, and a pointer to the `coffer-guide` skill for everything else. It MUST NOT restate the manual, MUST NOT name a retrieval tool, and MUST NOT carry the catalogue — the catalogue is in the skill body, which costs a session nothing until a model opens it. A built-in tool whose experimental feature is switched off is not in the tool list, and the instructions MUST NOT name it either ([experimental-features](../experimental-features/spec.md) "Withdraw what a switched-off feature put in front of agents").

#### Scenario: the handshake names Coffer's tools and points at the skill
- **GIVEN** a real daemon driven over its `/mcp` endpoint by the MCP SDK
- **WHEN** the client initializes, both with upstream tools hidden and with none hidden
- **THEN** the `instructions` text is within its character cap, names `coffer__write`, `coffer__recall`, `coffer__diagnose` and `coffer__search_tools`, and points at the `coffer-guide` skill for the rest
- **AND** it names no retrieval tool and carries no collection catalogue
