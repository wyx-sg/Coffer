## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Report what needs a person across every kind
`GET /api/v1/attention` and `coffer attention` MUST list what needs a person
now, from every source whose experimental feature is on: the reconciler's
drift that a pass could not fix, MCP servers whose last test failed, whose
launcher is missing or whose cited secret is absent, agents whose program is
missing, whose connection is partial or who are not connected, a sync stopped on
a conflict or holding deletions, and channels reconnecting, disconnected or not
running. Each item MUST carry its kind, the resource's uid and title, a stable
reason code with one sentence, a severity (`error`, `warning`, `info`), when
the condition was first seen where that is known, and exactly one action: a
verb and the REST route and body the kind's own page uses — the list has no
write of its own. A source that fails MUST be reported beside the others'
items, and the answer MUST count the items per kind.

#### Scenario: each item carries one action from its kind's own page
- **GIVEN** an MCP server whose last test failed and a partially connected agent
- **WHEN** the user reads the attention list
- **THEN** the server's item offers `test` through `POST /api/v1/resources/mcp_server/{uid}/test`, the agent's offers `connect` through `POST /api/v1/agents/{uid}/coffer-connection`, errors sort before warnings, and the counts name one item for each kind

#### Scenario: a failing source does not hide the others
- **GIVEN** one source that raises and one that has an item
- **WHEN** the attention list is read
- **THEN** the item is listed and the failing source is reported with its error

#### Scenario: a switched-off feature's signals are left out
- **GIVEN** an attention source tagged with a registered experimental feature that is switched off, holding an item it would report
- **WHEN** the attention list is read
- **THEN** that source's item is not listed and the source is not reported as failing
