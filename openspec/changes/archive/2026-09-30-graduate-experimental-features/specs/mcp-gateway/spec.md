## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Forward tools, resources and prompts
The system MUST forward MCP `tools`, `resources`, and `prompts` capabilities (list, call/read/get, and
list-changed notifications) between clients and upstream MCP servers.

- **Tools-only upstreams.** An upstream that implements only `tools` and replies with JSON-RPC `-32601`
  (METHOD_NOT_FOUND) for `resources/list` or `prompts/list` MUST be treated as having no resources / no
  prompts: the per-server capability view and the aggregate lists return that server's tools with an empty
  resources/prompts set (HTTP 200), not an error.
- **Built-in tools.** Coffer's own built-in tools under the reserved `coffer__` prefix MUST be exactly
  `coffer__search_tools` and `coffer__write`. Both MUST always be advertised in
  `tools/list`; `coffer__write`'s contract is [knowledge](../knowledge/spec.md)'s. A call to any other `coffer__` name MUST be
  answered as an unknown tool.
- **Built-in tool retrieval.** `coffer__search_tools`
  ([Tool Overload](../../../docs/decisions/tool-overload-tier-the-list-search-the-rest.md)) has the contract
  `coffer__search_tools(query: string [required], top_k?: int = 5, max 20) -> { tools: [{ name, description,
  inputSchema, score }], total_searched: N }`. It ranks the **live** aggregated upstream catalogue against the
  query and returns the top-k **real** upstream tool schemas, which the agent then calls directly; it is a
  retrieval primitive and MUST NOT select-and-invoke on the agent's behalf. Ranking MUST be a pure,
  deterministic, local keyword ranker (BM25-lite over each tool's name + description, with name tokens
  weighted higher) — no LLM, no embeddings, no network. Results MUST be upstream-only (Coffer's own
  `coffer__` built-ins excluded); each returned `name` is the same `<server>__<tool>` identifier the agent
  would call directly, with routing unchanged; and the invocation MUST be recorded in the invocation log like
  any other gateway call.
- **Budgeted listing ("tool tiering").** `tools/list` MUST advertise a budgeted slice of the catalogue rather
  than all of it ([Tool Overload](../../../docs/decisions/tool-overload-tier-the-list-search-the-rest.md)).
  Coffer's own `coffer__*` tools are always listed and do not consume the budget. Upstream tools are listed in
  full while they fit the budget (default 50, `COFFER_TOOL_TIERING_BUDGET`); beyond it the gateway lists the
  most-invoked ones over a trailing window (default 90 days, `COFFER_TOOL_TIERING_WINDOW_DAYS`), reserving one
  slot per server so no server becomes wholly invisible. Unlisted is **not** disabled: `tools/call` MUST gate
  on the capability preference, never on list membership, so an unlisted tool routes exactly as before, and
  `coffer__search_tools` keeps ranking the **full** catalogue. Tiering MUST fail open —
  `COFFER_TOOL_TIERING=off`, or any failure of the usage query, lists everything. The split is not reported on
  a management page.
- **`initialize` instructions.** The `initialize` response MUST carry an MCP `instructions` string stating
  what Coffer is and that `coffer__search_tools` reaches whatever tiering left unlisted. It is capped (~800
  characters) and omits the tiering sentence when nothing is actually hidden.
- **Degraded upstream discovery.** When a server misses the per-server discovery budget its tools are left
  out of that listing, but the server MUST be **named**, retried in the background, and on recovery the
  gateway MUST emit `notifications/tools/list_changed` so the client re-lists.

#### Scenario: resources forward through the gateway
- **GIVEN** an upstream server exposes resources (not only tools),
- **WHEN** a client reads a resource by its coffer URI,
- **THEN** coffer routes the read to the originating upstream with the URI rewritten back to its upstream form and returns the upstream payload unchanged.

#### Scenario: prompts forward through the gateway
- **GIVEN** an upstream server exposes prompts (not only tools),
- **WHEN** a client invokes a prompt by its `<server>__<prompt>` namespaced name,
- **THEN** coffer routes the request to the originating upstream with the original (unprefixed) prompt name and returns the upstream payload unchanged.

#### Scenario: upstream tool list changes mid-session
- **GIVEN** a client is connected and an upstream MCP server's tool list changes (upgrade, plugin reload),
- **WHEN** the upstream emits a list-changed notification,
- **THEN** coffer forwards the notification to every client whose session subscribes to that upstream so the client re-lists, and coffer's cached capabilities are refreshed on next list.

#### Scenario: search the aggregated catalogue for matching tools
- **GIVEN** N upstream tools are aggregated and healthy through coffer,
- **WHEN** an agent calls `coffer__search_tools` with an intent query and a `top_k`,
- **THEN** it receives at most `top_k` ranked real upstream tool schemas (upstream-only, with Coffer's own `coffer__` built-ins excluded), each named `<server>__<tool>`, the response reports `total_searched`, and the gateway records the invocation.

#### Scenario: the gateway advertises exactly two built-in tools
- **GIVEN** a client connected through coffer
- **WHEN** it lists tools, and calls `coffer__recall` and `coffer__diagnose`
- **THEN** the `coffer__` tools listed are exactly `coffer__search_tools` and `coffer__write`
- **AND** both calls are answered as unknown tools
