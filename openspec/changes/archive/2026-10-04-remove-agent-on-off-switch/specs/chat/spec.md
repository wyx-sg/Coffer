## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Ship Claude Code and Codex subprocess providers on the type's one agent
**Reason**: The requirement carried a scenario, "a disabled agent does not answer for its type", and the sentences it illustrated. An agent can no longer be disabled; the rule that a turn runs against its type's one agent returns, without them, under the title "Run Claude Code and Codex as subprocess providers on the type's one agent".
**Migration**: See "Run Claude Code and Codex as subprocess providers on the type's one agent". Citations of the old title move to the new one.

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Offer and run only managed agents
Chat MUST offer an agent only when its CLI is installed on this host and an
agent of its type is registered with Coffer (added on the Agents page);
an agent that is not installed, or installed but not added, MUST NOT
be offered for selection. A turn for a type with no registered agent MUST be
refused with an `agent_not_managed` rejection rather than run against the CLI's
own default config directory, which Coffer was told to leave alone. With no
managed agent at all, the draft surface is replaced by a state that links to the
Agents page.

#### Scenario: an unmanaged agent type is not offered and runs no turn
- **GIVEN** the `claude_code` CLI is installed but no `claude_code` agent is registered
- **WHEN** the provider is asked whether it is available and a turn is started on it
- **THEN** it is not available and the turn is refused as `agent_not_managed`
- **AND** once an agent of that type is registered, the provider is available and the turn runs

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Run Claude Code and Codex as subprocess providers on the type's one agent
System MUST ship subprocess-backed agent providers for Claude Code and Codex.
Each runs in a working directory (its `agent_config.cwd`); when a turn supplies
none, the provider MUST default to the Coffer-managed workspace
`~/.coffer/content/workspace` (created on first use) rather than reject the turn — so a
client with no configured workspace works out of the box. An
explicitly-supplied cwd MUST be an existing directory or the configuration is
rejected. Availability MUST reflect two things: whether the agent's binary is
resolvable on the user's PATH (the login shell's PATH merged with the daemon's
inherited one), and whether an **agent of that type is registered** with
Coffer; an agent failing either is unavailable and is not offered (see "Offer
and run only managed agents").

A turn MUST stream the tool's line-delimited JSON output mapped onto the
platform's turn events, and persist the upstream session id so the next turn
continues the same session. Claude Code is driven through the Claude Agent SDK
and Codex through `codex app-server` (JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio, NDJSON-framed);
both run with full permissions — owner pairing
([channels](../channels/spec.md)) is the security gate.

Both MUST emit the reply as text increments *as it is written*, not as one
block at the end of the turn, otherwise a live surface has nothing to grow and
a reply lands all at once after a long silence. The Claude Agent SDK does this
only when asked (`include_partial_messages`), and it then delivers BOTH the
increments and the finished assistant message, so the adapter MUST subtract
what it already emitted and send the reply exactly once.

A turn MUST run against the config directory of its type's one agent
([agent-registry](../agent-registry/spec.md) "Keep one agent per type, named by
it") — the same one whose models the pickers offer
([agent-registry](../agent-registry/spec.md) "Serve each agent type's model
catalogue from its one agent"); a type with
no registered agent has no turn at all. Coffer delivers skills, installs its
MCP entry and edits config files in that directory, so a turn that read any
other one would not see them. When that agent's `config_dir` is not its type's
standard location, the spawned process's environment MUST carry the variable the
product reads it from — `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=<config_dir>` for Claude Code,
`CODEX_HOME=<config_dir>` for Codex — merged with the daemon's own environment;
for the standard location the environment MUST be left as the daemon's own, so
the process behaves as when the user runs the CLI themselves. No provider key
rides the environment: an API-key connection is reached through Coffer's model
proxy.

#### Scenario: a streamed reply reaches the consumer exactly once
- **GIVEN** a Claude Code turn whose SDK delivers the reply as streamed increments and then as the finished assistant message
- **WHEN** the adapter maps the turn onto platform events
- **THEN** the reply arrives as one text delta per increment, in order
- **AND** the joined deltas equal the reply once, not doubled by the finished message
- **AND** the stream ends with a terminal turn-done

#### Scenario: a turn on an agent with its own config directory runs against that directory
- **GIVEN** a `claude_code` agent registered with a `config_dir` other than `~/.claude`, and a `codex` agent registered with a `config_dir` other than `~/.codex`
- **WHEN** a turn runs on each
- **THEN** the Claude Code process is started with `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` set to the agent's `config_dir`, and the Codex app-server with `CODEX_HOME` set to its `config_dir`, the rest of the daemon's environment intact
- **AND** a turn on an agent whose `config_dir` is its type's standard location starts its process with the environment untouched
